USE
----

To use this program simply run the "sh makeall.sh" command which should both compile and run the program.
Alternatively, you can run the "make all" command and then run the executable that is produced with "./main"


1. The use of this program allows the user to enter a specific key (16 hexadecimal digits) or one can be
generated.

To do this the program will prompt you to either enter the key or enter -1 for a random key to be generated.

2. The program similarly allows for user inputted IV or generation of one.

Again a prompt will ask you to enter an IV (16 hexadecimal digits) or enter -1 for a random IV to be generated.

3. The program also asks for a filename for the output file (encryption or decryption)

The program will prompt you to enter a file name.

4. To select between encryption and decryption, enter either 1 for encryption or 2 for decryption.

5. To select file to be used as input, enter the filename if the file is in the correct directory or
enter the filepath.

Output is printed both in the console and the file that the user has specified.
